{"name":"WaterMe","body":"### WaterMe - a #RHoKSoton project\r\nThis repository contains the code for the WaterMe project developed at the Random Hacks of Kindness event in Southampton, UK.\r\n\r\n![A screenshot of one of the maps we produced.](http://i.imgur.com/ptIK6.png)\r\n\r\nThe best way to find out what this project is all about is to look at the presentation that we gave for judging at the #RHoKSoton event - that can be found [on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EcM9wqO9KxbfrsDO6pLYhm2GbcLfeQHXXSLguV8PdeU/edit)\r\n\r\nThe project's code is split into two parts: WaterMe (this repository) which provides the user interface and API, and WaterMeFeeder (repository [here](https://github.com/RHoKSoton/WaterMeFeeder)) which provides the 'backend' for downloading data, processing it and adding it to a database.\r\n\r\nThe original problem specification is available [here](http://www.rhok.org/problems/development-operational-water-stress-product-satellite-imagery), and the RHoK solutions page is available here.\r\n\r\nFor more details please see the README files in both repositories.","tagline":"Visualises the amount of water in foliage using satellite data.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
